# Overview

This software is used to remove all pixels matching a pattern, and setting them to transparent. This can be used to modify images that do not have transparent backgrounds to ones that do. The need for tool like this has come up for me personally many times, so this proides an easy way to cut out the background of images.

Specifically, when you search for images you may find an image you want to use, but the background isnt transparent and you don't have any way to remove an, for example all white background.

# Development Environment

This was written entirely in Visual Studio Code.

This project uses the Tkinter, and OpenCV python libraries to open files and process images.

# Useful Websites

- [TKinter python library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

# Future Work

- Support multiple types of image types
- Select colors to remove instead of keeping only 1
- Offer more image manipulation techniques, like GIMP
